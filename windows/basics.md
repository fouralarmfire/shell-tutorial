# Basic Commands

If you were able to set up git correctly, run:
```
git clone https://github.com/fouralarmfire/shell-tutorial
cd shell-tutorial
```

If not run:
```
mkdir shell-tutorial
cd shell-tutorial
```

Then run `pwd`. You should see `C:\Users\<your_name>\shell-tutorial`.

Now we're going to find out what exactly you just made happen.

The following commands are the ones you will end up using every day to do basic stuff.
As we talk through them, type each one into your terminal, play around and see what they do.

Do not worry about breaking stuff. It would be very, very hard for anything to go wrong with these commands.
Some of them are designed to throw errors, but don't panic. Either ask for help, hit google, or just type something that makes
sense to you; again, it is very hard to break anything using these commands.

Take notes if you want, type them (and I mean type; no copy-pasting) until you are comfortable with what they do.
