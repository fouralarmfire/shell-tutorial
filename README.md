# Learn how to Shell

Welcome to this beginner's shell class!

First of all what is Shell? In a nutshell (ha!), shamelessly ripped off from Wikipedia, shell is:
```
A shell script is a computer program designed to be run by the Unix shell, a command-line interpreter.
The various dialects of shell scripts are considered to be scripting languages.
Typical operations performed by shell scripts include file manipulation, program execution, and printing text.
```
Essentially a shell (or whatever, slightly poor, imitation Windows is trying to push) is a session in your
terminal or command prompt (the thing hackers in movies use) into which you enter commands to make your computer
do some exciting things. A shell script is a program written in a language the shell (terminal) can understand,
interpret and execute. Shell scripting is useful because it saves us from having to type each thing we want to
do, line by line, at the moment we want it. Instead we can write everything we need to get done in a script,
and simply run the program.

There are many good tutorials out there (for example, [The Beginner's Guide to Shell Scripting: The Basics](http://www.howtogeek.com/67469/the-beginners-guide-to-shell-scripting-the-basics/#) from HowToGeek)
and pretty much any question you can think of has already been answered by someone on [stackoverflow.com](http://stackoverflow.com/),
but the goal of this class is to get you past the first hurdle of learning how to run around the depths of your
computer via shell: fear that you are going to damage it irreparably.

This is totally possible, there are certain commands that will do exactly that. For example you should never
ever run `rm -rf /` on your machine. Or anyone else's, please. But doing that accidentally (or being tricked into
doing so by some asshole on some hacker forum) is far less likely if you understand what that command is doing.

When it comes to programming, whether web-development or software-engineering, the command line and the various shells
are the most useful and powerful tools at your disposal. You don't want to be that coder who can't even use git.

The exercises will vary slightly depending on which operating system you are running. The systems covered are
