To complete this task you will need to know about [modular arithmetic](https://betterexplained.com/articles/fun-with-modular-arithmetic/),
[operators](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix/unix-basic-operators.htm), [command substitution](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/utilities/xcu_chap02.html#tag_02_06_03) and maybe a bit more about [if/else statements](http://ryanstutorials.net/bash-scripting-tutorial/bash-if-statements.php).

### Challenge Yourself!
- Set a default message for when no number is passed to your script.
- Write a for-loop to run your fizzbuzz against all numbers 1-1000000
  - make sure you also print out which number says what
